 * the holder's disclosed claims: the statement the verifier requires is decided
 * by the verifier, independent of anything the holder discloses. A verifier that
 * prefers the name-based DSL can compile it once against its credential schema
 * via `compilePredicateExpression` and reuse the resulting `predicates` /
