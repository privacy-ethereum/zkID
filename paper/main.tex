%%%% 7. PAPER CONTENT %%%%
% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sec:introduction}
% Introducing DI and Selective disclosure. From Selective Disclosure to VCs lead to Anonymous credential.
% In Anonymous credential, talking about related works and their main approaches.
% \textit{In this section, we will present the definition of the scheme, the need for it, and our scope of work.}
% \input{intro.tex}
% \subsection{Problems and our scope of work}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item What are we trying to solve, which pain points? 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{\href{https://mirror.xyz/privacy-scaling-explorations.eth/zRM7qQSt_igfoSxdSa0Pts9MFdAoD96DD3m43bPQJT8}{This doc} dive deeper in the current problems and some current tool could be used \\ in future solutions}
%         \item \textbf{Answer described in this docs, \href{https://www.notion.so/pse-team/External-zkID-ZKP-Wallet-Unit-Proposal-1bad57e8dd7e80c98d73fc7e7666375d?pvs=25\#1bad57e8dd7e8059a446ca7b1dc31323}{Short-term Deliverables $\&$ Further Exploration}}
%         \item \textbf{And in this \href{https://pse.dev/en/projects/zk-id}{doc}} 
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
% \subsection{Our achievements}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item We need to describe zkID as simple as possible. What is it based on, like, well-known terms, and well-known algorithms?... \textit{I don't know the final zkID construction yet. Based on \href{https://pse-team.notion.site/zkID-Team-Strategy-Proposal-db3c5788dc7a4916a33e580a79177053}{\textbf{this proposal}}, I think there is a PoC construction, but I don't have access permission to it.}
%     \jbel{the full architecture and POC don't exist yet -- there are several streams going in parallel (some people thinking about architecture, some people benchmarking to inform that, some people creating a POC)}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item What are the main achievements, main results of our work?
%         \item What are the properties that our scheme satisfies?
%         \item What is the best experiment results and the environment of it?
%     \end{itemize} 
% \end{itemize}
% \subsection{Related work and how they make things right}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Before us, are there any solutions for these problems, and what are their pros and cons?
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Overrall about current approaches is listed in \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YROCEHK_t10wo5CukgYWmS1nuYKZi46NJBu-XZ8zXiw/edit?slide=id.p\#slide=id.p}{this presentation} (also in \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HqFtSiS2hVHaSS8-u-8iecVFeMehMGBtZJnnbnXj83c/edit?slide=id.g34d4bb36836_0_262\#slide=id.g34d4bb36836_0_262}{this shorter version}), 
%  need to dig deeper to know how they solve these problems above.}
%         \item \textbf{\href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C4D8zK4gAdafgIEW-2m_qDyyT39gWo0mmFYpwmA8N3M/edit?slide=id.g312b09519cd_0_8\#slide=id.g312b09519cd_0_8}{This slide} also describe similar content but dive deeper in technical, and have the proposal design constraints.}

\section{Application to EUDI}
\label{sec:appeudi}

\input{eudi_application}
% \jbel{Links to read (we can basically copy paste a lot from these):
% \begin{itemize}
% \item EUDI ARF (full) \href{https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/}{here}
% \item Discussion of Google/Microsoft pros/cons \href{https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts4-zkp.md}{here}
% \item Google's IETF draft for libZK \href{https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-google-cfrg-libzk-00.html#name-sumcheck}{here}
% \end{itemize}}

% Why should EUDI consider this report?
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Does it compatible with current EUDI decision like data format and ecosystems?
%     \item Why governments or organizations should choose this scheme?
%     \item \textbf{Our pros and cons are already shown in other sections, so just mentioned them when we need them in this section}
% \end{itemize}

\section{Security}
\label{sec:security}

\input{security}

\section{Preliminaries - WIP}
\label{sec:preliminaries}
% \ndhy{This section is a work in progress. It will be completed in the next few days.}
\input{preliminaries}

% Give a detailed answer and analysis for:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Is the scheme a dishonest majority setting or something else? What happens when the setting is broken?
%     \jbel{\begin{itemize}
%         \item ZK is addressing malicious verifier -- semihonest 
%         \item soundness -- address malicious prover
%         \item trust assumption - verifier is trusted/honest, issuer is trusted/honest
%         \item deniable presentation? -- ask YT
%     \end{itemize}}
        
%     \item If the Issuer needs to update frequently, what if they are disconnected for a while? 
%     \item Place the scheme into a poor network connection, does it still work well and not be vulnerable?
%     \jbel{depends on solution to revocation flow, and also what applications of ID presentation look like (e.g. are the prover and verifier talking through internet channels?)}
% 	\item If it fails during the process, what will happen?
% 	\item If it is not quantum resistant, how do we upgrade it to quantum resistant? -- it is quantum resistant
% \end{itemize}

\section{Our zkID}
\label{sec:contribution}
% \textit{main deliveries: 1. describe zkID; 2. the detailed construction}
\input{zkID_construction.tex}

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
\input{experiments.tex}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item What are the exact communication, computation, and storage costs of \begin{itemize}
%         \item The PID Provider \& Verifier.
%         \item User who uses a mobile (iOS, Android) or browser?
%         \item The detailed cost of setup, proving, and verifying steps.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item What is the minimum hardware configuration? 
% \end{enumerate}

% \textbf{We can extract the benchmark results from \href{https://hackmd.io/@clientsideproving/zkIDBenchmarks}{this doc} (it's \href{https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkid-benchmarks}{git repo}) }

% \jbel{Still waiting 1-2 weeks for benchmarks on the POC}

% Notably, we also show the detailed comparison between our zkID and solutions from GG and Microsoft.
