\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Introducing DI and Selective disclosure. From Selective Disclosure to VCs lead to Anonymous credential.
% In Anonymous credential, talking about related works and their main approaches.
\textit{In this section, we will present the definition of the scheme, the need for it, and our scope of work.}

\subsection{Problems and our scope of work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are we trying to solve, which pain points? 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://mirror.xyz/privacy-scaling-explorations.eth/zRM7qQSt_igfoSxdSa0Pts9MFdAoD96DD3m43bPQJT8}{This doc} dive deeper in the current problems and some current tool could be used \\ in future solutions}
        \item \textbf{Answer described in this docs, \href{https://www.notion.so/pse-team/External-zkID-ZKP-Wallet-Unit-Proposal-1bad57e8dd7e80c98d73fc7e7666375d?pvs=25\#1bad57e8dd7e8059a446ca7b1dc31323}{Short-term Deliverables $\&$ Further Exploration}}
        \item \textbf{And in this \href{https://pse.dev/en/projects/zk-id}{doc}} 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Our achievements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We need to describe zkID as simple as possible. What is it based on, like, well-known terms, and well-known algorithms?... \textit{I don't know the final zkID construction yet. Based on \href{https://pse-team.notion.site/zkID-Team-Strategy-Proposal-db3c5788dc7a4916a33e580a79177053}{\textbf{this proposal}}, I think there is a PoC construction, but I don't have access permission to it.}
    \jbel{the full architecture and POC don't exist yet -- there are several streams going in parallel (some people thinking about architecture, some people benchmarking to inform that, some people creating a POC)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What are the main achievements, main results of our work?
        \item What are the properties that our scheme satisfies?
        \item What is the best experiment results and the environment of it?
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Related work and how they make things right}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Before us, are there any solutions for these problems, and what are their pros and cons?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Overrall about current approaches is listed in \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YROCEHK_t10wo5CukgYWmS1nuYKZi46NJBu-XZ8zXiw/edit?slide=id.p\#slide=id.p}{this presentation} (also in \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HqFtSiS2hVHaSS8-u-8iecVFeMehMGBtZJnnbnXj83c/edit?slide=id.g34d4bb36836_0_262\#slide=id.g34d4bb36836_0_262}{this shorter version}), 
 need to dig deeper to know how they solve these problems above.}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C4D8zK4gAdafgIEW-2m_qDyyT39gWo0mmFYpwmA8N3M/edit?slide=id.g312b09519cd_0_8\#slide=id.g312b09519cd_0_8}{This slide} also describe similar content but dive deeper in technical, and have the proposal design constraints.}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Google solution: Tradeoffs and Considerations. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Pros: 
                \end{itemize}
                
            \item Microsoft solution: Tradeoffs and Considerations.
            \item Our zkID:
                * preprocessing 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}
\textit{Foundational concepts to understand zkID}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item  High level overview of the parties and the trust assumptions with each one
   \
\end{enumerate}


\section{Our zkID}
\label{sec:contribution}
\textit{main deliveries: 1. describe zkID; 2. the detailed construction}

\input{zkID_construction.tex}

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the exact communication, computation, and storage costs of \begin{itemize}
        \item The PID Provider \& Verifier.
        \item User who uses a mobile (iOS, Android) or browser?
        \item The detailed cost of setup, proving, and verifying steps.
    \end{itemize}
    \item What is the minimum hardware configuration? 
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{We can extract the benchmark results from \href{https://hackmd.io/@clientsideproving/zkIDBenchmarks}{this doc} (it's \href{https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkid-benchmarks}{git repo}) }

\jbel{Still waiting 1-2 weeks for benchmarks on the POC}

Notably, we also show the detailed comparison between our zkID and solutions from GG and Microsoft.


\section{Application to EUDI}
\label{sec:appeudi}

% \jbel{Links to read (we can basically copy paste a lot from these):
% \begin{itemize}
% \item EUDI ARF (full) \href{https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/}{here}
% \item Discussion of Google/Microsoft pros/cons \href{https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts4-zkp.md}{here}
% \item Google's IETF draft for libZK \href{https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-google-cfrg-libzk-00.html#name-sumcheck}{here}
% \end{itemize}}

Why should EUDI consider this report?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does it compatible with current EUDI decision like data format and ecosystems?
    \item Why governments or organizations should choose this scheme?
    \item \textbf{Our pros and cons are already shown in other sections, so just mentioned them when we need them in this section}
\end{itemize}

\section{Security}
\label{sec:security}

Give a detailed answer and analysis for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the scheme a dishonest majority setting or something else? What happens when the setting is broken?
    \jbel{\begin{itemize}
        \item ZK is addressing malicious verifier -- semihonest 
        \item soundness -- address malicious prover
        \item trust assumption - verifier is trusted/honest, issuer is trusted/honest
        \item deniable presentation? -- ask YT
    \end{itemize}}
        
    \item If the Issuer needs to update frequently, what if they are disconnected for a while? 
    \item Place the scheme into a poor network connection, does it still work well and not be vulnerable?
    \jbel{depends on solution to revocation flow, and also what applications of ID presentation look like (e.g. are the prover and verifier talking through internet channels?)}
	\item If it fails during the process, what will happen?
	\item If it is not quantum resistant, how do we upgrade it to quantum resistant? -- it is quantum resistant
\end{itemize}
